Procedure SquareRoot
Input: num (a positive number)
// Your code here
Start
Input the number (num) for which you want to find the square root
Input a guess (guess) for the square root
Set a tolerance (tol) for how close the guess needs to be
Initialize a variable previous_guess to 0
Repeat until the absolute difference between guess and previous_guess is less than tol:
Set previous_guess to the value of guess
Update guess using the formula:
guess = 0.5 * (guess + num / guess)
Output guess as the square root of num
End Procedure
